INVITATION FOR THE 6TH EUROSYMPOSIUM
ON SYSTEMS ANALYSIS AND DESIGN
<br /><br />
Background:
<br /><br />
SIGSAND is the Association for Information Systems (AIS) Special
Interest Group on Systems Analysis and Design. SIGSAND provides services
such as annual symposia, news, research and teaching tracks at major IS
conferences, listserv and special issues in journals. The EuroSymposia
were initiated by AIS Vice President Prof. Keng Siau as the
SIGSAND-Europe Initiative.
<br /><br />
The Polish Chapter of Association for Information Systems (PLAIS) was
established in 2006 as the joint initiative of Prof. Claudia Loebbecke,
former President of AIS and Prof. Stanisław Wrycza, University of
Gdańsk, Poland. PLAIS co-organizes international and domestic
conferences on systems analysis and design as well as on Business
Informatics and Software Engineering, e.g., BIR 2008 – International
Conference on Business Informatics Research and CAiSE’12 – International
Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering.
<br /><br />
Overview:
<br /><br />
The EuroSymposium on Systems Analysis and Design has the objective of
promoting and developing high quality research on all issues related to
systems analysis and design (SAND). It provides a forum to researchers
and practitioners in SAND in Europe and beyond to interact, collaborate
and develop the systems analysis and design area. The EuroSymposium is
currently headed by the Advisory Board consisting of prominent
researchers to guide this initiative.<br /><br />
Previous EuroSymposia were held at:
<br />
     University of Galway, Ireland – 2006
     University of Marburg, Germany – 2008
     University of Gdańsk, Poland – 2007, 2011, 2012
