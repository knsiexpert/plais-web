Nasz b. aktywny w AISie Kolega - Prof. Piotr Soja znów przesłał zaproszenie (poniżej) na listę AISWorld. Rzadki głos z Polski. W statystyce aktywności mamy na tej liście jedno z ostatnich miejsc, na pewno. Profesor jest świetnym przykładem roztropnego, aktywnego  członkostwa w AISie, utrwalając swoje nazwisko na profesjonalnym, międzynarodowym forum AISu. Dziękuję i gratuluję!
<br/><br/>
No i wspólnie czekamy na Waszą pozytywną reakcję.

AMCIS 2014 CFP Mini-Track: Enterprise System Adoption and Business Models<br/>
 <br/>
Track: Enterprise Systems (SIGEntSys)<br/>
 <br/>
Savannah, Georgia, USA, August 7-10, 2014<br/>
 <br/>
Deadline for submissions: March 1, 2014<br/>
 
Enterprise systems (ES) are extremely complex software packages designed
for integrating data flow across an entire company, emerged from earlier
MRP, MRP II and ERP systems. Over time, ES have expanded to include more
and more areas of an organization's operations, and have extended
organizational boundaries and support interorganizational activities.
Today's enterprise systems are expected to support modern organizations
that operate in dynamic and turbulent business environments, compete in
global markets, face mergers and takeovers, and participate in business
alliances and joint ventures.<br/><br/>
 
Frequently, the adoption of an ES is an enormous challenge for an
organization, due to system complexity, organizational context and the
people involved in the implementation project. Usually, ES adoption is a
long and multi-stage process during which various problems and
complications may occur. Moreover, ES adoption projects typically
involve a large number of stakeholders representing different
departments, various organizational hierarchies, and often external
companies operating in various industries. These stakeholders may have
conflicting interests, and their own definitions of project success.
Overall, ES implementation projects tend to be very unique and
challenging endeavors.<br/><br/>
 
Providers of enterprise systems have traditionally relied on strong
revenues from maintenance fees, in addition to license revenue.
Nowadays, shorter product lifecycles, rising consulting revenues, Open
Source Software and SaaS are impacting their business models. ES
providers have the challenge of delivering systems which are highly
customizable software products, able to fit the needs of a variety of
adopters. This might be important since, as prior research suggests, the
issue of alignment between ES and adopting organizations is one of the
determinants of successful enterprise system implementation.<br/><br/>
 
This mini-track invites papers that examine various aspects related to
the determinants of ES success and business models. Both empirical and
theoretical papers are invited. The general research questions addressed
in this mini-track can be formulated as follows: What are the mechanisms
determining successful ES adoption? What are the underlying business
models of companies delivering successfully adaptable ES? What kind of
business models exist?<br/><br/>
 
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:<br/>
.    motivation and justification for ES adoption,<br/>
.    alignment between ES and adopting organization,<br/>
.    barriers and impediments to ES adoption success,<br/>
.    risk factors in ES adoption,<br/>
.    critical failure factors for ES adoption,<br/>
.    critical success factors for ES adoption,v
.    understanding of ES adoption success,<br/>
.    evaluation and benchmarking of ES projects,<br/>
.    multi-cultural and multi-national issues,<br/>
.    multiple stakeholder perspective in ES adoption and use,<br/>
.    business model frameworks for ES providers,<br/>
.    impact of new trends within the software industry on business models,<br/>
.    business model innovation for standard software companies,<br/>
.    implications of shorter product lifecycles on business models,<br/>
.    SaaS related business models,<br/>
.    open source software related business models.<br/>
