* Business Informatics *<br />
Business Informatics is the scientific discipline targeting information processes and related phenomena in their socio-economical business context, including companies, organisations, administrations and society in general.
Business Informatics is a fertile ground for research with the potential for immense and tangible impact. As a field of study, it endeavours to take a systematic and analytic approach in aligning core concepts from management
science, organisational science, economics information science, and informatics into an integrated engineering science.
<br /><br />
The field of Business Informatics involves a broad spectrum of more specific research domains that focus on important aspect of informatics in the context of organizations, ecosystems and society at large. These domains include: Business Model Innovation, Business Process Engineering, Empowering & Enabling Technologies, Enterprise Architecture, Enterprise Engineering, Enterprise Modelling, Enterprise & Business Transformation, Method Engineering, Service Innovation & Engineering, Social & Frontier Technologies Some domains take technology as a starting point and position them as enabler/driver of socio-economic activities, while some domains do the reverse, i.e. take socio-economic issues as a starting point and consider ways in which information technology can provide solutions. Key is, in all cases, bridging between information technological aspects and their socio-economical context.
<br /><br />
* Goal of the conference series *<br />
The goal of the CBI series of conferences is to bring together existing Business Informatics related research domains and stimulate discussion, synergy and integration of their respective research results and activities. Accordingly, the CBI conferences use a format that enables an in depth discussions among researchers in their respective domains during the conference. In addition, the contributions and discussions among the different domains are channelled towards a series of books dedicated to Advances in Business Informatics. 
For more information on the CBI series, refer to: www.cbi-series.org<br />
<br />
* Proceedings *<br />
The proceedings of the CBI series are published by the IEEE as a electronic publication with its own ISBN number. The proceedings are made avalable to the conference participants by means of a USB stick, while also being included in the IEEE digital library.
<br /><br />
* Reviewing *<br />
All papers will be reviewed by at least 3 reviewers.<br />
<br />
The reviewing process of the CBI conference series aims to provide authors with valuable feedback on their papers, even when a submission is rejected. As such, the CBI conference series operates under the principle that a serious submission deserves a serious review.

* Topics of papers *<br />
The CBI conference focuses on papers that clearly relate business and informatics, where papers typically will take one of the two as their primary starting point. Next to that, since BI is very much a practical field, papers that focus case studies are also explicitly asked for. As such, authors are encouraged to submit papers covering three tracks:<br />
1: Business with Informatics, which focuses on topics within the societal context of informatics, i.e. the "B" in BI. This includes, e.g. Business-IT alignment.<br />
2: Informatics for Business, which focuses on IT as an enabler of new business and/or societal developments, i.e. the "I" in BI.<br />
3:  Case studies, reporting on practical cases of business informatics. For such papers, we suggest the authors to follow the STARR structure: Situation, Tasks to be done, Activities used to achieve these tasks, Results delivered, and a Reflection on the case.<br />
<br />
