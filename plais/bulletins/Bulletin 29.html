***************
BACKGROUND
***************

SIGSAND is the AIS special interest group on System Analysis and Design.
SIGSAND provides such services as annual symposia news, research, and
teaching, tracks at major IS conferences, listserv and special issues in
journals.

The Polish Chapter of Association for Information Systems (PLAIS) was
established in 2006 as the joint initiative of Prof. Claudia Loebbecke,
former President of AIS and Prof. Stanislaw Wrycza, University of Gdansk,
Poland. PLAIS co-organizes international and domestic conferences on Systems
Analysis and Design, as well as on Business Informatics, e.g. BIR 2008 -
International Conference on Business Informatics Research.

***********
OVERVIEW
***********

The EuroSymposium on Systems Analysis and Design has the objective of
promoting and developing high quality research on all issues related to
systems analysis and design. It provides a forum to researchers and
practitioners in SAND in Europe and beyond to interact, collaborate and
develop the Systems Analysis and Design area. The EuroSymposium is currently
headed by an Advisory Board consisting of prominent researchers to guide
this initiative. Previous EuroSymposia were held at:
