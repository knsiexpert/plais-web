CALL FOR PAPERS<br />
The 9th SIGSAND/PLAIS EUROSYMPOSIUM on Systems Analysis and Design INFORMATION<br />
SYSTEMS: DEVELOPMENT, RESEARCH, APPLICATIONS, EDUCATION <a href="www.eurosymposium.eu">www.eurosymposium.eu</a><br />
 <br />
BACKGROUND<br />
The EuroSymposium on Systems Analysis and Design has the objective of promoting and
developing high quality research on all issues related to systems analysis and
design (SAND). It provides a forum to researchers and practitioners in SAND in
Europe and beyond – to interact, collaborate and develop the systems analysis and
design area. <br />
The event has the hybrid form – the accepted papers can be presented at the venue
site or by videoconferencing.<br />
The EuroSymposium is currently headed by the Advisory Board and International
Programme Committee composed of prominent researchers to guide this initiative.  
Therefore, there are three organizers of the 9th EuroSymposium on Systems Analysis
and Design are as follows: <br />
•        SIGSAND is the Association for Information Systems (AIS) Special Interest Group on
Systems Analysis and Design. SIGSAND provides services such as annual symposia,
news, research and teaching tracks at major IS conferences, listserv and special
issues in journals. The EuroSymposia were initiated by the past AIS Vice President
Prof. Keng Siau as the SIGSAND-Europe Initiative.<br />
•        The Polish Chapter of Association for Information Systems (PLAIS) was established
in 2006 as the joint initiative of Prof. Claudia Loebbecke, University of Cologne,
Germany, former President of AIS and Prof. Stanislaw Wrycza, University of Gdansk,
Poland. PLAIS co-organizes international and domestic conferences on systems
analysis and design as well as on Business Informatics and Systems Engineering.<br />
•        The Department of Business Informatics of the University of Gdansk is conducting
intensive teaching and research activities. The Department is also active
internationally, organizing conferences including the 10th European Conference on
Information Systems (ECIS 2002), The 7th International Conference on Perspectives in
Business Informatics Research (BIR 2008), The 8th International Conference on
European Distance and E-learning Network (EDEN 2009) and 24th Conference on Advance
Information Systems Engineering (CAiSE 2012). The Department is the partner of the
European Research Center for Information Systems (ERCIS) consortium.<br />
