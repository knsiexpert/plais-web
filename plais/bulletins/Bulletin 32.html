Press Release:

The American Grants and Loans Catalog is now available. Our new and revised
2011 edition contains more than 2800 financial programs, subsidies, 
scholarships, grants and loans offered by the US federal government.

In addition you will also have access to over 2400 programs funded 
by private corporations and foundations. That is over 5200 programs 
available through various sources of financial providing organizations.

NEW: You will also have access to our live Database that is updated 
on a daily basis. This product also provides daily email alerts as programs 
are announced.

The Database is also available with IP recognition. This allows you to login
without a username or password (Great for libraries or educational 
institutions who want their users to access the database).

Businesses, students, researchers, scientists, teachers, doctors, private 
individuals, municipalities, government departments, educational 
institutions, law enforcement agencies, nonprofits, foundations 
and associations will find a wealth of information that will help them 
with their new ventures or existing projects.

The document is a fully searchable PDF file for easy access to your 
particular needs and interests. Simply enter your keywords to search
