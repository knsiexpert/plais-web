Drodzy PLAISowicze,
 <br /><br />
Spełniam więc prośbę Isabel. Nie, to nie ta: ...Oh, Isabel, moun amour, Isabel ... z gorącej piosenki Ch. Aznavuriana (w rzeczywistosci to Ormianin), kierowcy a przy okazji kochanka niezrównanej Edith Piaff (czyli Wróbelka) ;-)
 <br /><br />
Isabel prosi mnie o promowanie  poniższego zaproszenia szeroko w Polsce, co niniejszym z wielką przyjemnością czynię.<br /><br />
Z pozdrowieniami,<br />
 <br />
 
Stanisław Wrycza<br />

Subject: [ECIS 2015 - RIS workshop] Requesting your help to disseminate information<br />
<br /><br />
Dear Stanislaw, Dear Colleagues and Friends,<br /><br />

Thank you again for accepting our invitation to join the Program
Committee of the ECIS 2015 workshop - Resilience and Information
Systems.<br /><br />

The workshop  is now announced in the webpage of ECIS2015 -
http://www.ecis2015.eu/participation/list-of-workshops/resilience-and-information-systems
<br /><br />
We need your help to promote the workshop by sending out the call for
papers to your contacts. Please, find the call for papers below. Thank
you.
<br /><br />
We are looking forward to collaborating with you all in this new event
and to seeing you there (an opportunity to discuss how to proceed with
nserr - http://nserr.dsi.uminho.pt/)

<br />
The workshop focuses research in designing resilience into regions and
organizations so they display a sustained capacity for change,
therefore increasing their ability to survive a crisis and thrive in
contexts of high uncertainty. Relevant research must address the role
Information Systems and Technologies can play in managing the
collective and distributed capacities to (1) anticipate potentially
disrupting events; (2) avoid or prevent their occurrence;  (3) plan
and prepare for disruption required to protect the organization /
community /region; (4) recover to a new fully functional state and
assure continued operations.
<br /><br />
The workshop addresses, more specifically, the following aspects of
resilience and information systems and technologies:
<br /><br />
1) How people, resources, information systems and infrastructures be
designed and managed so that the organization/community/region
displays a high level of resilience to economic crisis (Economic
crisis can be triggered by many factors, including severe
environmental hazards, war, depletion of traditional energy resources,
major demographic changes, generalized social uprisings,
cyber-attacks, pandemics, major market changes - demand, supply,
technology - and questionable business and financial practices);
<br /><br />
2) The connection between resilience and the creation of smarter
cities. (Planning for resilience to the impacts of stressors within
cities requires an evaluation of the vulnerable components of cities,
an understanding of the key processes, procedures, and interactions
that organize these components and develop the capacity to address
various structuring of components and their interactions with the
ultimate goal of achieving resilience);
<br /><br />
3) The need for IS solutions that leverage indigenous knowledge and
are built with frugal engineering practices. (A focus on indigenous
knowledge is important for creating solutions that make sense within
emerging economies. Frugal engineering is a new method of development
that assesses the needs of the market as well as what the market can
spend to respond to growing demands and tighter budgets);
<br /><br />
4) The need for appreciation of how crowdsourcing solutions can drive
entrepreneurship and innovation in the context of economic resilience
by supporting new models for growth of enterprises;
<br /><br />
5) The role that Information Systems/Technologies can play during and
after a disaster to enable local disaster management and resilience
(e.g. crowd and mobile apps).
<br /><br />
The purpose of the workshop is to bring together IS scholars who are
conducting research into Information Systems to support/enable
resilient organizations, communities and/or regions to economic
crises, which is a topic within the field of IS that is gaining
relevance given the many sources of uncertainty lying ahead. The
workshop will provide a forum within which participating scholars and
practitioners can collaborate to determine the scope and thematic
content of the area of IS for Resilience.
