Dear Stanislaw,

Congratulations! Your group is among the 21 AIS SIGs and Chapters to earn the designation of Outstanding SIG or Chapter for 2014. It is part of the inaugural group to receive this recognition.

I thoroughly enjoyed reading your annual reports highlighting your groups’ accomplishments in 2014. The groups receiving the Outstanding SIG or Chapter recognition excelled in SIG/Chapter operations, member communications, educational and/or professional development events, and research publications.

Patrick Dockins, AIS Component Relations Manager, will follow up with more information about how you can share this news with your constituents. You can also expect to see an announcement to the AIS membership in the next issue of the AIS InSider e-newsletter.

I look forward to seeing your continued success in 2015!

2014 Outstanding Components Awards

We are pleased to announce 21 SIGs and Chapters earned the designation of Outstanding SIG or Chapter for 2014. This is the inaugural group to receive this new recognition. 

 

The AIS Council created this new recognition program to celebrate the great work being done by our SIGs, Chapters, and Colleges. This program is designed to recognize groups that do an outstanding job of supporting the mission of AIS through the advancement of knowledge and the promotion of excellence in the practice and study of information systems. Some of the criteria included holding events, tracks, or workshops, publishing journals or articles, officer transitions, internal communications, and more.

 

“The hard work and dedication of all of the officers and members of the Outstanding SIGs and Chapters is truly impressive," said Julie Kendall, AIS VP for SIGs, Chapters, and Colleges. "They have achieved success because of their willingness to invest not only their intellectual capital but also their sweat equity into their group. Bravo!”.  

 

Please join us in congratulating these recipients by reaching out to the group leaders. Thank you to all of the groups that submitted their 2014 annual reports and applications. Keep up the great work!
