 Dear Stanislaw,
<br /><br />
 

please find below the Call for Papers for the Enterprise Modeling track at the European Conference on Information Systems 2015. In order to advertise the track and solicit high quality papers I would kindly ask you to distribute the Call for Papers found below in your communities and institutions. You are of course highly welcome to submit papers to the track yourself and encourage your teams to do so as well.
<br /><br />
 

With kind regards,
<br /><br />

CALL FOR PAPERS ECIS’2015
<br /><br />
Track: Enterprise Modeling
<br /><br />
European Conference on Information Systems, May 27-29, 2015, Muenster, Germany http://ecis2015.eu/participation/list-tracks/10-enterprise-modeling
<br /><br />
*********************************************************************************
<br /><br />
 

The purpose of this track is to focus on a core topic in business and information systems engineering research. Enterprise modeling is an established approach for the conceptual representation, design, implementation and analysis of information systems and has gained much attention in academia as well as in industry.
<br /><br />
Enterprise modeling is today of primary importance to develop, analyze and deploy information systems that operate in today’s user-driven world with massive amounts of ex- changed information. It contributes with the conceptualization, implementation, and use of machine processable languages to facilitate the interaction with complex business and technological scenarios, engage in knowledge management and support organizational engineering. In addition, the development of reference models for selected domains, the design of generic models for enterprise architecture management, and the development of modeling tools are investigated.
<br /><br />
In this track the discussion shall be fostered both on the foundations and applications in enterprise modeling, as well as on the model-based development and evolution of enterprise- wide IS from a conceptual / business perspective. For the description of innovative and rigorously elaborated research results a wide variety of research methodologies are welcomed including but not limited to design science research, mathematical modeling, simulation, case studies, as well as empirical approaches.
<br /><br />
