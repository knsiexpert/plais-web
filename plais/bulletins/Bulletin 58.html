CALL FOR PAPERS

  The 7th SIGSAND/PLAIS EuroSymposium'2014

  on Systems Analysis and Design

  Information Systems:
  Development, Applications, Education

  September 25, 2014

  Gdańsk, Sopot - Poland

  eurosymposium.eu



  ============================================================================================

  BACKGROUND

  Systems analysis and design (SAND) has been the central field of research
and education in the area of management information systems (MIS) or, as it
is called more frequently in Europe, Business Informatics, almost from its
origins. SAND continuously attracts the attention of both academia and
business. The rapid progress of information and communications technology
naturally generates the requirements for new generations of SAND methods,
techniques and tools. Therefore, international thematic conferences and
symposia have become widely accepted forums for exchanging of concepts,
solutions and experiences in SAND. In particular, the Association for
Information Systems (AIS) is undertaking the initiative towards SAND’s
international development.

  Therefore, there are three organizers of the 7th EuroSymposium on Systems
Analysis and Design are as follows:

  SIGSAND is the Association for Information Systems (AIS) Special Interest
Group on Systems Analysis and Design. SIGSAND provides services such as
annual symposia, news, research and teaching tracks at major IS conferences,
listserv and special issues in journals. The EuroSymposia were initiated by
AIS Vice President Prof. Keng Siau as the SIGSAND-Europe Initiative.

  The Polish Chapter of Association for Information Systems (PLAIS) was
established in 2006 as the joint initiative of Prof. Claudia Loebbecke,
former President of AIS and Prof. Stanisław Wrycza, University of Gdańsk,
Poland. PLAIS co-organizes international and domestic conferences on systems
analysis and design as well as on Business Informatics and Software
Engineering, e.g., BIR 2008 – International Conference on Business
Informatics Research and CAiSE’12 – International Conference on Advanced
Information Systems Engineering.

  The Department of Business Informatics of the University of Gdansk is
conducting intensive teaching and research activities. Some of its academic
manuals are bestsellers in Poland. The Department is also active
internationally, organizing conferencs including the 10th European
Conference on Information Systems (ECIS 2002), The 7th International
Conference on Perspectives in Business Informatics Research (BIR 2008), The
8th International Conference on European Distance and E-learning Network
(EDEN 2009) and 24th Conference on Advance Information Systems Engineering
(CAiSE 2012). The Department is the partner of the European Research Center
for Information Systems consortium.
