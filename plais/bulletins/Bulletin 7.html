Dear Colleagues,

The deadline for submission of the papers  for The Second European Symposium 
on Systems Analysis and Design is approaching (February 18th, 2007).
To attract more attention for the event  we have prepared its brochure 
and poster (http://sigsand.univ.gda.pl/).  Please print the leaflet 
and distribute the copies among your collaborators and potentially 
interested professionals and institutions. Please expose also 
the poster at your Department board.

Thank you for your cooperation,

Prof. Stanislaw Wrycza
Symposium Program Chair
