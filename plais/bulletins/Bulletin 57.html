Hello Stanislaw
<br /><br />
As a member of the ECEL 2014 Committee I thought you would like to know that this a FINAL CALL for papers for the 13th European Conference on e-Learning ECEL-2014 being held at Aalborg University Copenhagen, Denmark on 30-31 October 2014.
<br /><br />
This call will close on 10th April 2014 so now would be a good time to send the call to your contacts and colleagues one more time. We hope that you will consider submitting a paper yourself to the conference – and remember that as a member of the committee, providing you review one or two papers for us you will be eligible for a 20% discount on the conference fee (discount code CMD100) – or you can pay a full fee and bring a non-presenting student with you for no charge. You can download a pdf of the call for paper to go on your noticeboard: <a href="http://academic-conferences.org/pdfs/ECEL_2014-cfp.pdf" target="_blank">http://academic-conferences.org/pdfs/ECEL_2014-cfp.pdf</a>
